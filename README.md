I am Mahbub E Waduzzaman, a student at Centennial College in Toronto, Canada, where I am pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology. During my studies, I have honed my programming skills in various languages including C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I possess a thorough understanding of software design, web design, web application development, Linux/Unix operating systems, Windows command line, agile software development, Git, Eclipse, and Oracle SQL. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong team player with the ability to learn quickly and pay attention to detail.
